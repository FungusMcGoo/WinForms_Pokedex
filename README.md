A simple Pokedex app with SQL server connectivity, coded in Visualbasic.

Pokedex must be connected to a database or localdb, the code and parameters are simple enough to switch out with your own.
Final repo will include: db file, image folder, and vb.net code for the pokedex.

Unsure of where to find descriptions of all pokemon so Im researching a possible solution to either scrape descriptions from Bulbapedia / Serebii. Ive also just found out about PokeAPI as Im typing this.
