A simple Pokedex app with SQL server connectivity, coded in Visualbasic.

Pokedex must be connected to a database or localdb, the code and parameters are simple enough to switch out with your own.

Once the database has been finalised I will export it to .csv and add to the repo so it can easily be imported into your SQL. Currently I am unsure of commiting a database to Github so this seems like an easy compromise.
